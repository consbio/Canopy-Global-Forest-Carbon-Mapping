# Canopy Global Forest Carbon Mapping Scripts
This repository contains Python scripts authored by the Conservation Biology Institute for use in the Canopy-Global-Forest-Carbon-Mapping project. 
The goal of this project is to produce a raster dataset that identifies forest regions that warrant conservation prioritization on the basis of their high carbon density. 
This dataset is being created for the Canopy organization (Vancouver, BC, Canada) for integration into their ForestMapper tool as both a stand-alone layer and as an additional component of the aggregated Ancient and Endangered layer.
